## SRC
- CSV files should be outside the src folder
- Level1: Load the exercise.csv file into the internal data structure. This implies the ability to see the loaded data while interacting with the GUI: CORRECT :) The model is loaded as expected		
- Level 2: Select and record an exercise for the day. The selection is stored in the database (log.csv) & the log view is updated in relation to the calories expended via the exercise - The calculation is wrong. NOTE: I need to use the date picker to select the current date  every time a food/exercise is selected for the log. Only then, i will see the change, when food is added. 	
- Level 3: Add new exercise to the exercise database. This implies the ability to then add such exercise to today's log as in level 2 - the functionlity works AND the log landed in the model as well :)
- Level 4: to read a non-empty log.csv file, to navigate to different days in the log, and to select exercises for the days other than today.	- works :)	
- Level 5: the ability to save the log and exercise data structure back to the log.csv and exercise.csv files on any change while the user interacts with the GUI to manage the exercises. works

MVC + Composite - checked during the OH - you know what needs to be done!
